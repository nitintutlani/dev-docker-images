Collection of useful docker images for development tasks

I am preparing these images/repos for use in deploying Openshift v3 projects. Most images here use alpine linux to keep the resulting S2I images small and fast.

# alpine-node
  Use this image to serve node projects. Adjusted for completely non-root usage with openshift v3 deployment details.

# redis
  Use this image to run redis server. Adjusted for completely non-root access.

# nginx-php-fpm
  Use this image to serve nginx php-fpm websites. Adjusted for completely non-root usage with openshift v3 deployment details.

# nginx-website
  Use this image to serve nginx based static websites. Adjusted for completely non-root access.

# anpn
  Use this image to setup non root alpine nginx php fpm nodejs
